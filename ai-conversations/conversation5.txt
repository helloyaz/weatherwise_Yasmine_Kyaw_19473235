Conversation about parsing weather logic and how to include natural language considerations in my code. [26/05]






ME: Before any functions, what is the section for Natural Language Processing asking for and what are the main elements to parse weather content that I should consider?
The preliminary comments provided are # Define parse_weather_question() and generate_weather_response() and # Define menu functions using pyinputplus or ipywidgets.

AI: 
    ✅ What this section is for:
    It's where you're expected to implement two core functions related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) in your weather application:
    
    parse_weather_question() – to interpret the user’s natural language input.
    
    generate_weather_response() – to generate a human-like response based on the parsed input and actual weather data.
    
    🧠 What should parse_weather_question() be doing?
    This function is responsible for understanding a user's natural language question about the weather — something like:
    To support these, the function needs to extract key elements from the sentence.
    
    🔍 Key elements to parse:
    Element	Purpose	Example Match
    Location	Which city/place the user is asking about	Perth, Sydney
    Time Period	Whether they want info for today, tomorrow, or multiple days	today, tomorrow, next 2 days
    Attribute	What kind of weather info they’re asking for	temperature, rain, weather
    
    These 3 pieces form the structure of meaning we want to extract from any user question.
    
    🛠️ What does generate_weather_response() do?
    Once the question is parsed into structured data (like {'city': 'Adelaide', 'days': 2, 'attribute': 'rain'}), this function:
    Uses that info to look up weather data
    Generates a natural-language response like:
    “Here’s the rain forecast for Adelaide: Tomorrow you can expect scattered showers 🌧️.”
    
    
    


ME: Can you give me an example of parsing logic you recommend and what are the key components that make up its function?
AI: 
Let's walk through an example parsing function and then break down the key components that make it effective.

✅ Example: parse_weather_question(question)
import re

def parse_weather_question(question):
    """
    Parse a natural language weather question.

    Args:
        question (str): User's weather-related question

    Returns:
        dict: Extracted info: city, days, attribute
    """
    question = question.lower()

    # Extract city using a basic list or fallback
    cities = ["perth", "sydney", "melbourne", "adelaide", "brisbane"]
    city = next((c.title() for c in cities if c in question), "Perth")

    # Extract forecast days
    if "tomorrow" in question:
        days = 2
    elif "today" in question or "now" in question:
        days = 1
    else:
        match = re.search(r"next (\d+) days?", question)
        days = int(match.group(1)) if match else 3

    # Identify weather attribute
    if "rain" in question or "umbrella" in question or "precipitation" in question:
        attribute = "precipitation"
    elif "temperature" in question or "hot" in question or "cold" in question:
        attribute = "temperature"
    elif "weather" in question or "forecast" in question:
        attribute = "general"
    else:
        attribute = "general"

    return {
        "city": city,
        "days": days,
        "attribute": attribute
    }
🔍 What makes this parsing logic effective?
Component	Purpose
question.lower()	Normalizes the input to lowercase for easier matching
City Matching	Uses a list of known cities and in to detect which one is mentioned
Time Parsing	Handles keywords like "today", "tomorrow", or "next X days" with regex
Attribute Detection	Matches user intent with weather types: temperature, rain, general, etc.
Fallback Defaults	Provides a default city ("Perth") and days (3) if not specified
Modular Output	Returns a dictionary so other functions can use the result easily


Once you have this parsing logic:
You can call your get_weather_data(city, days) function using the output.
Then generate a response using generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data).Let's walk through an example parsing function and then break down the key components that make it effective.




[CONVERSATION OMITTED - Asking to further explain parsing logic and terms, and clarifying that ipywidgets is the used extension]



ME: My function is coming up with a weird error. even though my previous function that defines parse_weather_question() ran correctly supposedly (showed the green check). 
What is this saying?
❌ Network or request error: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://wttr.in/In%20Brisbane%20Tomorrow?format=j1
⚠️ Sorry, I couldn't retrieve valid weather data.

AI: 
        Great catch — the issue is caused by how the city is parsed in the question:
        "Will it rain in Brisbane tomorrow?"
        Your function currently uses a basic pattern that matches everything after "in " — so it's grabbing "Brisbane tomorrow" as the city.
        
        🔍 The Problem
        The regex in this line:
        match = re.search(r"in ([a-zA-Z\s]+)", question)
        ...matches "in Brisbane tomorrow", causing city = "Brisbane Tomorrow" → which turns into a bad URL like:
        https://wttr.in/Brisbane%20Tomorrow?format=j1
        Hence the 404 error (invalid city).
        
        ✅ The Solution
        We need to strip out any time-related words like "today" or "tomorrow" from the captured city. Here's a fixed version:



ME: It's running correctly now, but can you explain each line and what its outputting?
AI:Absolutely — let's work on generate_weather_response() together. This function’s job is to take:
        
        The parsed user question (e.g., city, days, weather attribute)
        The weather data fetched from wttr.in
        And return a friendly, natural-language answer like:
        "Yes, it looks like it will rain in Brisbane tomorrow. Don’t forget your umbrella!"
        
        ✅ Here's the function:
        def generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data):
            """
            Generate a natural language response to a weather question.
            Args:
                parsed_question (dict): Parsed question data with city, days, and attribute
                weather_data (dict): Weather data returned from get_weather_data()
            Returns:
                str: Natural language response
            """
            if not weather_data or "forecast" not in weather_data or not weather_data["forecast"]:
                return "⚠️ Sorry, I couldn't retrieve valid weather data."
            city = parsed_question.get("city", "your location")
            days = parsed_question.get("days", 1)
            attribute = parsed_question.get("attribute", "general")
            forecast = weather_data["forecast"][:days]
            if attribute == "rain":
                mentions_rain = any(
                    any(word in day["condition"].lower() for word in ["rain", "shower", "thunderstorm", "drizzle"])
                    for day in forecast
                )
                if mentions_rain:
                    return f"☔ Yes, it looks like there will be rain in {city} over the next {days} day(s). Don’t forget your umbrella!"
                else:
                    return f"🌤️ No rain is expected in {city} during the next {days} day(s). Looks like dry weather ahead!"
            elif attribute == "temperature":
                temps = [(day["min_temp_C"], day["max_temp_C"]) for day in forecast]
                response = f"🌡️ Here's the temperature forecast for {city}:\n"
                for i, day in enumerate(forecast):
                    response += f"• {day['date']}: {day['min_temp_C']}°C – {day['max_temp_C']}°C, {day['condition']}\n"
                return response.strip()        
            elif attribute == "wind":
                # Wind is part of current_condition; not supported in forecast by wttr.in JSON
                current = weather_data.get("current", {})
                wind_kmph = current.get("windspeedKmph", "N/A")
                return f"🌬️ Current wind speed in {city} is {wind_kmph} km/h."        
            else:
                # General overview
                response = f"📍 Weather overview for {city}:\n"
                for day in forecast:
                    response += f"• {day['date']}: {day['condition']}, {day['min_temp_C']}°C – {day['max_temp_C']}°C\n"
                return response.strip()


        🧠 Let’s break it down:
        🧩 Step 1: Check for missing data
        if not weather_data or "forecast" not in weather_data or not weather_data["forecast"]:
        This makes sure the API didn't fail. If so, return a friendly fallback message.
        
        🧩 Step 2: Unpack parsed data        
        city = parsed_question.get("city", "your location")
        days = parsed_question.get("days", 1)
        attribute = parsed_question.get("attribute", "general")
        This extracts info from the user’s question: which city?, for how long?, what weather type?
        
        🧩 Step 3: Process forecast data        
        forecast = weather_data["forecast"][:days]
        We slice the forecast for the number of days the user asked about.
        




ME: How can I improve this code, as changing the day description, for e.g. Will it rain in Perth this week' vs. 'Will it rain in Perth tomorrow' brings up different answers. 
    How can I fortify this function?
AI:
        Great observation — your parse_weather_question() function needs stronger parsing logic to accurately extract meaning from variations like:        
        "tomorrow"
        "this week"
        "today"
        "in 3 days"
        "next weekend"
        
        To fortify it and make it more robust, we’ll:
        ✅ 1. Add Synonym and Phrase Detection
        Use more intelligent pattern matching to convert natural phrases into numbers, e.g.:
        
        Phrase	Days
        today	1
        tomorrow	2
        this week	5–7
        next week	7–14
        in 3 days	4
        weekend (Sat/Sun)	5–7
        
        ✅ 2. Update parse_weather_question() Logic
        Here’s an improved version:
        
        import re
        
        def parse_weather_question(question):
            """
            Parse a natural language weather question.
        
            Args:
                question (str): User's weather-related question
        
            Returns:
                dict: Extracted information including city, days (forecast range), and weather attribute
            """
            question = question.lower().strip()
        
            # Default values
            city = "your city"
            days = 1
            attribute = "general"
        
            # Weather attributes
            if "rain" in question:
                attribute = "rain"
            elif "temperature" in question or "hot" in question or "cold" in question:
                attribute = "temperature"
            elif "wind" in question:
                attribute = "wind"
        
            # Time phrases mapped to forecast days
            if "today" in question:
                days = 1
            elif "tomorrow" in question:
                days = 2
            elif "this week" in question or "over the week" in question:
                days = 5
            elif "weekend" in question:
                days = 6  # Assuming weekend is within the 6–7 day range
            elif match := re.search(r"in (\d+) days", question):
                days = int(match.group(1)) + 1
            elif "next week" in question:
                days = 7  # Could be extended to 7–14 with more data
        
            # Try to extract city after prepositions like "in" or "for"
            match = re.search(r"(?:in|for)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)", question)
            if match:
                city = match.group(1).strip().title()
        
            return {
                "city": city,
                "days": days,
                "attribute": attribute
            }
        ✅ Key Improvements:
        Improvement	How it Helps
        Synonym detection	Recognizes "hot", "cold", etc. as temperature queries
        Flexible time parsing	Maps "this week", "in 3 days", "weekend" correctly
        Regex fallback for city names	Grabs names after “in” or “for” regardless of position
        .title() on city	Fixes lowercase names like “brisbane” → “Brisbane”
        
    


ME: How would I make adjustments if I also want to add parse logic for weekday/weekend names e.g. "Is it going to rain this Wednesday'' and subsequent error handling if the requested day extends past the 3-day forecast limit of wttr.in?
AI: 🔧 Step 1: Recognize Weekday Names
        We'll map weekdays to their day-offset relative to today (e.g. if today is Monday and the user asks about Wednesday, it's 3 days ahead).
        
        We’ll use Python’s datetime to help.
        
        ✅ Updated parse_weather_question() with Weekday Support
        
        import re
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta
        
        def parse_weather_question(question):

            weekday_map = {
                "monday": 0, "tuesday": 1, "wednesday": 2, "thursday": 3,
                "friday": 4, "saturday": 5, "sunday": 6
            }
            today_idx = datetime.today().weekday()
        
            for weekday, target_idx in weekday_map.items():
                if weekday in question:
                    delta = (target_idx - today_idx) % 7
                    if delta == 0:
                        days = 1  # Today
                    else:
                        days = delta + 1  # wttr.in uses 1-based indexing
                    break
        
            # Enforce 3-day forecast limit
            if days > 3:
                raise ValueError("⚠️ The forecast only supports up to 3 days ahead (including today).")
        
            # Extract city name
            match = re.search(r"(?:in|for)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)", question)
            if match:
                city = match.group(1).strip().title()
        
            return {
                "city": city,
                "days": days,
                "attribute": attribute
            }
        📌 How This Works
        Logic Added	Purpose
        weekday_map	Converts weekday names to index (0 = Monday)
        datetime.today().weekday()	Gets today’s index to calculate offset
        delta = (target_idx - today_idx) % 7	Ensures day wrap-around (e.g. Sun → Mon)
        raise ValueError(...)	Prevents user from querying past the available 3-day limit
        
        ✅ Examples
        # Example 1 – Wednesday and today is Monday
        parse_weather_question("Will it rain in Brisbane this Wednesday?")
        # → {'city': 'Brisbane', 'days': 3, 'attribute': 'rain'}
        
        # Example 2 – Asking for Sunday on a Friday
        parse_weather_question("Is it going to be cold in Perth on Sunday?")
        # → {'city': 'Perth', 'days': 3, 'attribute': 'temperature'}
        
        # Example 3 – Asking for next Thursday on a Sunday (out of range)
        parse_weather_question("Will it be windy in Melbourne next Thursday?")
        # → Raises ValueError: ⚠️ The forecast only supports up to 3 days ahead
        🛠️ What Happens if the Question Exceeds the Forecast Range?
        Right now it will raise a ValueError. You can catch that when calling the function, like this:
        
        try:
            parsed = parse_weather_question("Will it rain in Perth next Friday?")
            weather_data = get_weather_data(parsed["city"], parsed["days"])
            print(generate_weather_response(parsed, weather_data))
        except ValueError as ve:
            print(ve)
        Would you like me to:
        
        ✅ Add better feedback instead of a raw error? (e.g. “Please rephrase your question for a date within 3 days.”)
        
        ✅ Integrate this into your UI section when we get there?
        
        Let me know and I can build it with you!




ME: Yes, should I just change the value error statement inside the function to have a better feedback?
AI: Yes, exactly! You can replace the raise ValueError(...) line inside your parse_weather_question() function with a custom message return or a graceful error strategy, depending on how you want your program to behave.

        ✅ Option 1: Return an error message instead of raising an exception
        Replace:
        raise ValueError("⚠️ The forecast only supports up to 3 days ahead (including today).")
        With:
        return {
            "error": "⚠️ Sorry, the forecast only supports up to 3 days ahead (including today). Please rephrase your question."
        }
        Then, when calling the function, check for the "error" key:       
        parsed = parse_weather_question("Will it rain in Perth next Friday?")        
        if "error" in parsed:
            print(parsed["error"])
        else:
            weather_data = get_weather_data(parsed["city"], parsed["days"])
            print(generate_weather_response(parsed, weather_data))
       
        ✅ Option 2: Keep raise ValueError(...), but catch it later
        You might keep your original exception-based version but wrap the caller in a try/except block for user feedback:       
        try:
            parsed = parse_weather_question("Will it rain in Perth next Friday?")
            weather_data = get_weather_data(parsed["city"], parsed["days"])
            print(generate_weather_response(parsed, weather_data))
        except ValueError as ve:
            print(str(ve))  # Or use a custom message
        This is cleaner if your UI will guide the user with error messages and you want parsing logic to stay strict.
        


[CONVERSATION OMITTED - choose 2, then changed decision and chose option 1. Reworked some edits into the function with chat correcting it]

        UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'city_match' where it is not associated with a value

AI:Thanks for catching that — you're seeing an UnboundLocalError because the line:

        if city_match:
        is being reached even when city_match wasn't assigned at all (i.e., if the re.search(...) line wasn't run due to earlier logic).
        
        Let’s walk through and fix this correctly.
        
        ✅ The Corrected Version of parse_weather_question()
        Here is the safe and improved full version of the function that:
        
        Handles the city name cleaning properly.
        
        Avoids undefined variable errors.
        
        Includes robust fallback and user feedback.

            Returns:
                dict: Parsed components including city, days, attribute, or an error message.
            """

            found_attr = next((attr for attr in attributes if attr in question), "general")

                days = 1

                        break
        
            # Step 3: Check forecast range limit
            if days > 3:
                return {
                    "status": "error",
                    "error": "❌ Sorry, only 3-day forecasts are available. Please choose today, tomorrow, or this week."
                }
        
            # Step 4: Extract city name
            city_match = re.search(r"in ([a-zA-Z\s]+)", question)
            if city_match:
                city = city_match.group(1).strip()
                # Clean up trailing words like 'this Wednesday'
                city = re.sub(r"\b(today|tomorrow|this week|this|" + "|".join(weekdays) + r")\b", "", city).strip()
            else:
                return {
                    "status": "error",
                    "error": "⚠️ Please include a location in your weather question (e.g. 'in Brisbane')."
                }
        
            # Return structured data
            return {
                "status": "ok",
                "city": city.title(),
                "attribute": found_attr,
                "days": days
            }
        ✅ Now when you run:
        
        user_question = "Will it rain in Perth this Wednesday?"
        
        parsed = parse_weather_question(user_question)
        
        if parsed.get("status") == "error":
            print(parsed["error"])
        else:
            weather_data = get_weather_data(parsed["city"], parsed["days"])
            print(generate_weather_response(parsed, weather_data))
        …it will properly extract:
        
        "Perth" as the city
        
        days = 3
        
        attribute = "rain"
        
        And it will avoid errors from bad city parsing or undefined variables.
        
        Would you like me to also double-check that generate_weather_response() is working as expected for these inputs next?
                
                
                


ME: It works now, which means the parsing logic is correct! Although this is correct and the outcome I wanted, can you help where the two temperature forecasts are returning from (as in which part of the function?). As for the current temperature and unknown condition, is it required to be in the function if this will be the only answers generated as wttr.in doesn't have numerical temp figures. 
Just overall wondering how I can further improve both the parse_weather_question() and Generate_weather_response() please!
                
AI:        
        How to check: Look inside your generate_weather_response() function and make sure: 
        You’re returning the final response as a return statement.
        You’re not also calling print() inside that function unless it’s for debugging.        
        
        wttr.in sometimes omits or simplifies the JSON response if data isn’t available or if it’s misinterpreting the location (e.g., “In Perth” instead of just “Perth”).
        You can improve resilience by:
        Adding fallback values.
        Ensuring the city name is cleaned before being passed to get_weather_data() (you’re already mostly doing this with .title()).
        Optionally skipping the current temperature section if it's N/A or empty.

        ✅ Improvements for parse_weather_question()
        Additions:
        Support abbreviations or shorthand:
        Improve city extraction:
        Strip out words like “this”, “next”, or day names from the city name if captured by regex:
        Log or print what was parsed (for debugging):
        
        ✅ Improvements for generate_weather_response()
        Suggested improvements:
        Check if current data is missing and show a message like:
        

        if not current_temp or current_temp == "N/A":
            response += "🌡️ Current temperature data not available.\n"
        Use attribute (rain, snow, etc.) to customize response:
        If the parsed attribute is "rain", tailor forecast response to only mention rain conditions.
        Avoid repetition if no new forecast data is found:
        Track and avoid printing duplicate days.




ME: Even though it runs technically, the resulting output says "⚠️ Please include a location in your weather question (e.g. 'in Brisbane')." even though Perth is already in the user prompt. How do I fix this bug?
AI: 🚨 The Bug
The for loop that removes trailing keywords from the city is not indented properly, so it’s running even when city_match fails, and then the else statement right after it is incorrectly attached to the for loop, not the if city_match.
This causes the parser to think no city was matched — even though "Perth" clearly was.

✅ Make sure the for loop is inside the if block, and the else is attached to the if city_match, not the for loop.
