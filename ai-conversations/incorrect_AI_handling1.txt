Conversation showing handling of AI's incorrect testing suggestion [27/05]


ME: I still want to go over my testing section that you suggested earlier with my edits. This is my whole function: 
    # Include sample input/output for each function
    
    # parsing logic and generating
    user_question = "Will it rain in Perth this Wednesday?"
    parsed = parse_weather_question(user_question)
    print(parsed)
    
    test_cases = [
        "Will it rain in Perth tomorrow?",
        "What's the weather in Sydney today?",
        "Is it sunny in Melbourne this weekend?",
        "Weather in Atlantis tomorrow?",
        "",
        "Hi"
    ]
    
    for question in test_cases:
        print(f"\n❓ Question: {question}")
        display(run_weather_advisor(question))
    
    and this is the output I get below when calling it. Is it normal for it to be so long? Can you break down the different lines in the output and which part in the function is calling it?

    🧪 YOUR TEST FUNCTION SUMMARY
    You’ve written a test block that does two things:
    
    ✅ 1. Test the parser separately:
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    user_question = "Will it rain in Perth this Wednesday?"
    parsed = parse_weather_question(user_question)
    print(parsed)
    This line calls your NLP parsing function and prints the resulting dictionary, e.g.:
    
    {'status': 'ok', 'city': 'perth', 'days': 2, 'attribute': 'rain'}
    ✅ 2. Test the full pipeline for 6 sample questions:
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    for question in test_cases:
        print(f"\n❓ Question: {question}")
        display(run_weather_advisor(question))
    Each loop:
    
    Prints the question
    
    Passes it to your full application logic: run_weather_advisor()
    
    That function:
    
    Calls parse_weather_question() again
    
    If valid, calls get_weather_data()
    
    Then calls format_weather_response() to generate a styled response
    
    Returns the result wrapped in HTML(...) for rich display
    
    🧾 OUTPUT STRUCTURE
    Let’s dissect a typical successful output:
    
    ❓ Question: Will it rain in Perth tomorrow?
    
    📍 Weather for Perth
    🌡️ Current Temperature: 18°C
    ⛅ Condition: Overcast
    
    📅 2025-05-27: light rain – 🌧️ Yes ✅
    📅 2025-05-28: cloudy – ☁️ No ❌






ME: The Atlantis bit is not right because this is the output received when all the tests are called below. As you can see, somehow Atlantis still outputs a weather forecast which we know is false since the location doesn't exist. What do you think is happening here?
    ❓ Question: Weather in Atlantis tomorrow?
    
    📍 Weather for Atlantis
    🌡️ Current Temperature: 32°C
    ⛅ Condition: Partly cloudy
    
    📅 Temperature Forecast:
      • 2025-05-27: 27°C – 32°C, partly cloudy  ☁️ – Cloudy skies
      • 2025-05-28: 26°C – 31°C, partly cloudy  ☁️ – Cloudy skies
    <h3>📍 Weather for Atlantis</h3><br><p>🔎 Current conditions are unavailable.</p><br><h4>📅 Temperature Forecast:</h4><ul><br><li>2025-05-27: 27°C – 32°C, partly cloudy  – ☁️ Cloudy skies</li><br><li>2025-05-28: 26°C – 31°C, partly cloudy  – ☁️ Cloudy skies</li><br></ul>
    
AI:
    Great observation — you're right to be skeptical. Here's what's going on, and why you're getting a real-looking forecast for "Atlantis", even though it doesn't exist:
    
    🚨 What's Happening with "Atlantis"?
    wttr.in (the API you're using) is surprisingly permissive about location names. When it receives a city name it doesn't recognize, it doesn't return an error. Instead, it often does one of the following:
    
    Fallback to a nearby or default location (e.g. "Mountain View", the location of the server)
    
    Return plausible-looking but generic data
    
    Use the city name as-is and return made-up forecast data
    
    ✅ Example:
    You queried:
    
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    "Weather in Atlantis tomorrow?"
    Your parser extracted:
    
    python
    Copy
    Edit
    {'status': 'ok', 'city': 'atlantis', 'days': 2, 'attribute': None}
    Then get_weather_data("atlantis") made a request:
    
    perl
    Copy
    Edit
    https://wttr.in/atlantis?format=j1
    That URL does not error — it gives you what looks like valid weather data, including temperatures and conditions.
    
    📌 Key Insight
    wttr.in will “make up” data if the location is not real or valid. It doesn't return a 404 or error in the JSON.
    
    You can confirm this by trying it in a browser:
    👉 https://wttr.in/atlantis?format=j1







ME: How can I handle this bug? Is this an issue with the function itself, or the original imported package?
 
AI: 💡 How to Handle This in Your Code
    You can detect invalid or suspicious cities by checking the API response. Unfortunately, wttr.in doesn't give an explicit "error" field — but you can do a few things:
    
    ✅ Option 1: Check if the "nearest_area" field exists and matches the input
    def get_weather_data(city, days=2):
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{city}?format=j1"
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
    
            # Optional validation check
            nearest_area = data.get("nearest_area", [{}])[0].get("areaName", [{}])[0].get("value", "")
            if nearest_area.lower() not in city.lower():
                print(f"⚠️ Warning: Location '{city}' may not be valid. Nearest area is '{nearest_area}'.")
    
            current = data.get("current_condition", [{}])[0]
            forecast = data.get("weather", [])[:days]
            return {"current": current, "forecast": forecast}
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error retrieving weather data: {e}")
            return None
    ✅ Option 2: Manually validate known cities (not great for global use)
    If this is just for your assignment, you could validate against a hardcoded list of Australian cities.
    
    🔍 Summary of Output Lines You See
    Output Line	Why It Happens
    📍 Weather for Atlantis	Returned by format_weather_response()
    🌡️ Current Temperature: 32°C	Returned from API, even though it's not real
    📅 2025-05-27: 27°C – 32°C, partly cloudy ☁️	Looks valid but is fabricated by the API
    ⚠️ Please enter a weather question.	Triggered when input is empty
    ⚠️ Please include a location...	Triggered when the parser can't find a city
    
    ✅ What You Should Do
    For your assignment, it’s enough to show you’re aware of this limitation. You could even write a short comment in your code like:
    
    # Note: wttr.in returns plausible weather data even for non-existent cities like 'Atlantis'.
    # This may lead to false positives unless additional validation is added.
    
    



ME: If want to implement a validation, which components in which sections do I need to edit?
AI: To implement validation for suspicious or invalid city names (like “Atlantis”), you only need to edit two key sections of your code:
    ✅ Sections to Modify
    1. 🛠️ Weather Data Function: get_weather_data(city, days=2)
    Add logic to check if the nearest area from the response matches the user input.
    
    2. 🧩 Main Application Logic: run_weather_advisor(user_question)
    Use the result of that validation check to display an error message if the city is invalid.
    
    🧱 Step-by-Step Edits
    🔧 1. Modify get_weather_data() to include a city validity check
    Replace your current function with this version:
    
    def get_weather_data(city, days=2):
        url = f"https://wttr.in/{city}?format=j1"
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            response.raise_for_status()
            data = response.json()
    
            # Extract nearest_area from response
            nearest_area = data.get("nearest_area", [{}])[0].get("areaName", [{}])[0].get("value", "")
            is_valid = city.lower() in nearest_area.lower()
    
            current = data.get("current_condition", [{}])[0]
            forecast = data.get("weather", [])[:days]
    
            return {
                "current": current,
                "forecast": forecast,
                "nearest_area": nearest_area,
                "is_valid": is_valid
            }
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error retrieving weather data: {e}")
            return None
    🧠 2. Update run_weather_advisor() to check for city validity
    Replace the logic after get_weather_data(...) with this:
    
    weather_data = get_weather_data(parsed["city"], parsed["days"])
    if not weather_data:
        return HTML("<b style='color:red;'>❌ Could not retrieve weather data.</b>")
    
    if not weather_data.get("is_valid", True):
        nearest_area = weather_data.get("nearest_area", "unknown")
        return HTML(
            f"<b style='color:red;'>❌ The city '{parsed['city']}' was not found. Did you mean '{nearest_area}'?</b>"
        )
    
    return HTML(f"<pre>{format_weather_response(parsed, weather_data)}</pre>")
