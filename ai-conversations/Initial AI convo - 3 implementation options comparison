Me: I'm creating a weather advising application and I have 3 routes I can take for implementing the weather data component. They're provided below: 

1. Foundation Option: Use the provided fetch-my-weather package 

A simplified interface to wttr.in weather services that handles API complexities
Provides consistent data structures and error handling
Allows you to focus on application logic and other components
Perfect for getting started and meeting core requirements

2. Standard Option: Use the wttr.in service API directly 

Example: https://wttr.in/London?format=j1 returns JSON data
Documentation: https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in
Requires implementing your own request handling and data processing
Demonstrates API interaction skills and offers more customisation

3. Extension Option: Implement your own solution with OpenWeatherMap or similar 

Requires obtaining and securely handling an API key
Offers access to more detailed weather data
Provides experience with commercial API integration
Eligible for bonus points if well-implemented with proper error handling22

I'm a complete novice with Python and programming in general, and struggle with easily understanding programming concepts, but I still want to be able to create a robust application. Can you help me compare these three options, and provide a starting off framework on what I should tackle for each option?
